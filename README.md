# Audiobook-player

A desktop audiobook player for Windows, built with Electron. Plays local files with
real chapter navigation, per-book resume, variable speed, and a sleep timer.

Planned features, differentiators, and performance work are tracked in
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Running it

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

> **Note:** if your shell has `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` set (VS Code's integrated
> terminal does this), `electron` runs as plain Node and no window appears.
> Clear it first: `$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=$null`.

On first launch, click **Add folder** and point it at your audiobook directory.

## How a library is interpreted

Real libraries mix two conventions, so the scanner splits on file type:

| Layout | Treated as |
| --- | --- |
| One `.m4b` / `.m4a` file | One book; chapters read from inside the file |
| A folder of `.mp3` tracks | One book; each track becomes a chapter |
| `Disc 1/`, `Disc 2/` subfolders | Merged into a single book |

A folder is only merged as discs when it has several audio subfolders *and* at
least one is disc-named — so a series folder holding separate books per subfolder
stays separate.

Multi-track books play as one continuous timeline: the seek bar, chapter list and
saved position are all in whole-book seconds, and playback rolls over file
boundaries on its own.

## Chapters

Chapters come from a hand-written MP4 parser (`src/main/mp4-chapters.js`) rather
than from `music-metadata`.

`music-metadata`'s `includeChapters` option does not surface **QuickTime text
chapter tracks** — a second `trak` with handler `text`, linked from the audio
track by a `tref`/`chap` reference — which is how essentially every `.m4b` in the
wild stores chapters. On a real library it returned zero chapters for every file.
The parser here reads that track directly (with a fallback to Nero `chpl` atoms),
which is both more robust and roughly 50× faster, since it does targeted reads
instead of decoding the whole file. It also recovers chapters from files
`music-metadata` refuses to parse at all.

## Where data lives

Everything is kept off `C:`. Paths are set in `src/main/paths.js` and can be
redirected with the `AUDIOBOOK_DATA_ROOT` environment variable.

```
D:\Claude\AudiobookPlayer\
  userData\       Electron/Chromium profile and caches
  covers\         extracted cover art
  library.json    scanned library
  progress.json   per-book listening position
```

Scanning a large library takes a few minutes the first time. Results are cached
against each file's size and mtime, so rescans only reparse what changed.

To scan without launching the app (useful for a first run):

```powershell
node prime.mjs "E:\Books"
```

`probe.mjs` dumps an MP4's box structure, which is the quickest way to see how a
particular file stores its chapters:

```powershell
node probe.mjs "path\to\book.m4b"
```

## Layout

```
src/main/
  main.js            app lifecycle, window, IPC
  paths.js           where app data is written
  library.js         scanning, tag reading, cover extraction
  group.js           files -> books (disc merging, m4b vs mp3-folder)
  mp4-chapters.js    MP4/M4B chapter + duration parser
  media-protocol.js  ab-media:// with byte-range support
  store.js           atomic JSON persistence
  preload.js         contextBridge API
src/renderer/        UI (no framework)
```

Audio is served over a custom `ab-media://` protocol with HTTP range support
rather than by disabling `webSecurity`, so seeking inside a 40-hour file doesn't
re-read from the start. The handler validates every request against the folders
actually in your library, so it can't be used to read arbitrary files.

## Known limitations

- **Series-tagged titles.** Some publishers set every volume's `album` tag to the
  series name. For single-file books the more specific `title` tag is used
  instead, but a multi-track book (a folder of mp3s) has only the series name to
  show, so volumes of the same series can render with an identical title even
  though they are correctly kept as separate books. The folder names distinguish
  them on disk.
- **Box sets stay whole.** A single file (or folder) containing several novels is
  one entry with one long chapter list; there is no reliable signal to split it
  into constituent books.
- **Merged m4b parts use one chapter per file.** When a book shipped as numbered
  `.m4b` segments is merged, each segment becomes one chapter; any chapters
  embedded inside a segment are not surfaced.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `←` / `→` | Back / forward 30s |
| `Shift` + `←` / `→` | Back / forward 5 min |
| `T` | Open the sleep-timer menu |
| `Esc` | Close the sleep menu, or go back to the library |

## Sleep timer

The moon control in the player bar stops playback after a set time — a fixed
duration (5–60 min), at the **end of the current chapter**, or at the **end of
the book**. The volume fades gently over the last 20 seconds rather than cutting
out. If you fall asleep, resuming rewinds 30 seconds so you don't lose your place,
and **+5 minutes** extends (or restarts) the timer and picks playback back up.
The duration countdown only runs while audio is playing, so pausing pauses it too.
